ðŸš€ Excited to tick off another milestone â€” Iâ€™ve completed the Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Virtual Internship Program on Forage!

This immersive experience gave me a chance to work through real-world tasks that Deloitteâ€™s analytics teams tackle â€” from data cleansing and visualization to deriving actionable business insights.

âœ… Strengthened my skills in Excel, data storytelling, and client-focused analysis
âœ… Gained exposure to consulting-style thinking and how data drives strategic decisions
âœ… Built confidence in translating raw data into clear recommendations

A big thank you to Deloitte Australia and Forage for making this opportunity accessible to students and early professionals around the world!

ðŸ“œ Proud to add this to my growing portfolio of practical experience.
